Writing Guidelines

- Mechanical terms should always use Pascal Case (e.g., Strong Hit, Weak Hit, Draw, Vitae, Radiance)
- "Draw" is only used for the core Draw mechanic (Action card + Score vs Challenge cards)
- Use "reveal" when revealing cards for other purposes like rolling on tables
- Never use second person (you, your, yourself). Always use third person: "the character", "the player", "themselves", etc.

**Wardens of the Duskwatch**

A penitent walks into the Derweald to keep their vows. The forest takes them back, piece by piece.

## The Derweald

The Derweald is a living rot: ancient, patient, and eternally hungry. Its roots burrow through soil and soul alike, drinking names, memories, and blood. What dies beneath its boughs does not rest. The dead rise again as Pallids: bark-bound, hollow-eyed, and mindless, thralls to spirits the Church of the One Light swore it had vanquished centuries ago.

But when the claiming comes swift as the wind, a rare few rise again with their minds intact, cursed with gifts they never asked for and the forest's hooks buried deep in their thoughts. These creatures are power, hunger, and forever. They are called Thornmouths.

The Order of the Duskwatch hunts Thornmouths without mercy and searches for those with resolve enough to fight the pull of the roots through Radiance and faith to welcome into their ranks as Wardens. The Order's priests carve root scars into their forearms with consecrated steel and pack the wounds with blessed salt until the flesh rises into knotted patterns. Body and soul both becoming a battleground.

Armed with blessed blades, whispered prayers, and salted steel, the Wardens are sent back into the thorns to fulfill their Vows, or die trying.

## What Is Needed

One standard deck of cards shared among the table, paper, and pencil. The game can be played solo, cooperatively without a Game Master (GM), or with a GM and one to four players.

Card values follow this scale: Aces count as 1, numbered cards use their normal value, and face cards are valued at 11 for Jacks, 12 for Queens, and 13 for Kings.

After a card is used, it is put in a discard pile. When the deck runs empty and cards are needed, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck.

## Making a Character

Players take a piece of paper (this will act as their character sheet) and then go through the following steps:

### 1. Name

Each player writes their own name on their character sheet.

### 2. Character Name

The player chooses a name for their character.

### 3. Scores

Scores measure a character's capabilities and resources.

**Core Scores** range from 0 to 5. During character creation, players distribute 8 points among the four Core Scores, with no single Score exceeding 3:

- **Strength**: Physical power. Governs brute force, heavy blows, and feats of might.
- **Dexterity**: Agility and precision. Governs quick reflexes, acrobatics, stealth, and ranged attacks.
- **Willpower**: Mental fortitude and presence. Governs resolve, perception, persuasion, and resisting corruption.
- **Constitution**: Endurance and toughness. Governs resilience, stamina, and resistance to physical hardship.

**Reserve Scores** fluctuate during play. All start at 5 during character creation, except Fortune which starts at 3:

- **Vitae (5)**: Physical and mental health.
- **Radiance (5)**: Inner light and resistance to corruption.
- **Supply (5)**: Provisions, ammunition, and expendable gear.
- **Fortune (3)**: Luck and fate's favor.

### 4. Records

Records are used to keep track of important facts about a character, specific items, or other important notes. There is no limit to how many Records a character can have. Relevant Records can help or hinder a character when tackling challenging tasks or when trying to avoid a direct threat.

During character creation, the player reveals a card for each category to determine their starting Records:

- **Weapon** (reveal 1): 1. Sword, 2. Axe, 3. Spear, 4. Bow, 5. Flail, 6. Dagger, 7. Mace, 8. Greatsword, 9. Crossbow, 10. Halberd, Jack. Warhammer, Queen. Quarterstaff, King. Whip
- **Armor** (reveal 1): 1–3. Cloak or Clothes, 4–6. Leather, 7–9. Chain, 10–11. Plate, 12–13. Shield
- **Gear** (reveal 3): 1. Lantern, 2. Rope, 3. Crowbar, 4. Lockpicks, 5. Chain, 6. Grapnel, 7. Torch, 8. Vials, 9. Compass, 10. Spikes, Jack. Mirror, Queen. Chalk, King. Trap Kit
- **Skill** (reveal 1): 1. Herbalist, 2. Blademaster, 3. Marksman, 4. Ritualist, 5. Beast Tamer, 6. Duelist, 7. Scout, 8. Magehunter, 9. Pathfinder, 10. Skirmisher, Jack. Shadowblade, Queen. Deathseeker, King. Spellbreaker

### 5. Gift

A Gift is power stolen from the Derweald and held by rite and restraint. Each character has one, added as a Record. During character creation, players choose one gift:

- **Stonehide**: Flesh hardens like stone, making it extremely hard to be wounded.
- **Bonegrind**: Channel brutal force, gaining unnatural strength.
- **Vinewright**: Control the roots and thorns to entangle, snare, pierce, or drag.
- **Wildtongue**: Command the warped creatures of the forest to do your bidding.
- **Soulgrip**: Seize hold of another's emotions and bend them to your will.

## Rules

### The Oracle

The Oracle is used to answer questions when the fiction is uncertain. It can be consulted freely during play to resolve unknowns, or triggered by specific Actions. To consult the Oracle, frame a yes-or-no question and reveal cards based on likelihood:

| Likelihood     | Cards |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Almost Certain | 4     |
| Likely         | 3     |
| 50/50          | 2     |
| Unlikely       | 1     |

- When there are more red cards (Hearts or Diamonds) than black, the answer is **Yes**.
- When there are more black cards (Spades or Clubs) than red, the answer is **No**.
- When there is a tie, the answer is **Yes, but...** with a complication.

### The Draw

All of the game's mechanics are called Actions: things that trigger when characters do certain things in the fiction. When an Action is triggered, it will outline that the player must make a Draw, usually in the form of "When this happens, Draw+Score." Follow the steps below to resolve the Action's outcome.

#### Making a Draw

The player draws 1 Action card and adds the relevant Score to the card's numeral value. Then, 2 Challenge cards are drawn. The player compares their Action total against each Challenge card.

If the player's Action total is higher than both Challenge cards, the Action resolves as a **Strong Hit**. The character succeeds at what they were trying to do and gains something extra.

If the player's Action total is higher than one Challenge card, the Action resolves as a **Weak Hit**. The character succeeds, but with a lesser effect or cost.

If the player's Action total is higher than neither Challenge card, the Action resolves as a **Miss**. The character fails or must make serious sacrifices to push forward.

Each Action will define how it resolves depending on whether it's a Strong Hit, Weak Hit, or Miss.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage

Advantage comes from favorable conditions, preparation, relevant Records, or invoking a Gift. For each level of Advantage, add +1 to the Action total.

Disadvantage comes from adverse conditions, wounds, missing gear, or hostile circumstances. For each level of Disadvantage, subtract 1 from the Action total.

#### Inflict Harm

When a character strikes at an enemy or engages a threat in combat, Draw+Strength for melee attacks, Draw+Dexterity for ranged attacks, or Draw+Willpower for arcane attacks.

There is no turn order or rounds. The fiction dictates who acts and what is possible. A blade cannot harm what it cannot reach. An armored creature will not fall to desperate slashing.

**On a Strong Hit**: The character strikes true and avoids retaliation.
**On a Weak Hit**: The character lands the strike but is harmed as a result.
**On a Miss**: The character misses, and is harmed as a result.

Minor threats fall in one or two decisive blows. Dangerous foes require multiple successes: each one is ground gained, a wound opened, an advantage seized.

**On a Weak Hit**: The character holds on, but the roots have taken hold. They stabilize at 1 Radiance but gain a permanent mark of corruption (add it as a Record).
**On a Miss**: The forest claims the character. They are removed from play and become a threat to those they once called allies.

#### Rest

After a character has rested, shuffle the discard pile back into the deck.

#### Make Camp

When a character makes camp in the wilds, Draw+Supply.

**On a Weak Hit**: The camp holds, but something stirs. Restore 2 Vitae, but face a complication or lose 1 Supply.
**On a Miss**: The camp is compromised. Restore 1 Vitae, and danger approaches.

#### Purify

When a character seeks to cleanse their soul and resist the forest's claim, Draw+Willpower.

If the character is at a place of holiness (a shrine, altar, sacred grove, or sanctuary blessed by the Church), take 1 Advantage. If the character performs a rite of purification (confessing sins at a relic, holding vigil while fasting, praying over running water, or pouring blood into salt), take 1 Advantage.

**On a Weak Hit**: The character feels the call of the roots. Lose 1 Radiance.
**On a Miss**: The character is overwhelmed by the call of the roots. Lose 2 Radiance.

If a character's Radiance ever reaches 0, the forest claims the character. They are removed from play and become a threat to those they once called allies.

## Getting Started

### The Opening Scene

Each player introduces their character: their name, what they look like, and one memory from before the claiming. Then frame the opening: the group is already mid-mission, deep in the thorns, with their Vow half-complete and trouble closing in.

### Group Vow

A Vow is a mission, the purpose that keeps the Order's mercy pointed forward. When the group completes a Vow, each character fully restores their Radiance and the group takes on a new Vow.

To generate a Vow, draw one card from each table and combine the results. Or choose elements that speak to you.
